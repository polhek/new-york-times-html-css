            <p>
              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s
              starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
              the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
              undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Inflation has
              been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
              including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. If
              corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
              comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the
              universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
              and speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the universe
              we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
              hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch
              in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
              unknowable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.
